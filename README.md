# MaskhaNER

## Project Overview

A web-based interface that will be used as a named entity recognition tool for African languages. Users of the system will be able to input a string of characters in an African language. This input will be used to train an NER model stored in the system. Feedback from the NER model will be displayed on the interface for users to see and give feedback on.
